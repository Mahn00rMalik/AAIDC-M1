# Understanding VAEs

<h2> Basic Concept and Architecture</h2>
VAEs are a class of generative models designed to encode data into a compressed latent space and then decode it to reconstruct the original input. The architecture of a VAE consists of two main components: the encoder and the decoder.

![VAE_architecture.png](VAE_architecture.png)

The diagram above illustrates the key components of a VAE:

1. <b>Encoder:</b> Compresses the input data into a latent space representation.
2. <b>Latent Space (Z):</b> Represents the compressed data as a probability distribution, typically Gaussian.
3. <b>Decoder:</b> Reconstructs the original input from a sample drawn from the latent space distribution.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h2> Comparison with Traditional Auto-Encoders </h2>

While VAEs share some similarities with traditional auto-encoders, they have distinct features that set them apart. Understanding these differences is crucial for grasping the unique capabilities of VAEs. The following table highlights key aspects where VAEs differ from their traditional counterparts:

User's question:
what is gradient boosting classifier

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LLM response:
*   Gradient boosted decision trees are among the most powerful and widely used models for supervised learning.
*   They require careful tuning of the parameters and may take a long time to train.
*   A common approach is to first try random forests, and if random forests work well but prediction time is at a premium, or it is important to squeeze out the last percentage of accuracy from the machine learning model, moving to gradient boosting often helps.
*   If you want to apply gradient boosting to a large-scale problem, it might be worth looking into the xgboost package and its Python interface, which at the time of writing is faster (and sometimes easier to tune) than the scikit-learn implementation of gradient boosting on many datasets.

Discussion
Transposing is a common operation in linear algebra where the column and row
indices of each element are swapped. One nuanced point that is typically overlooked
outside of a linear algebra class is that, technically, a vector cannot be transposed
because it is just a collection of values:
# Transpose vector
np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]).T
array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
However, it is common to refer to transposing a vector as converting a row vector to
a column vector (notice the second pair of brackets) or vice versa:
# Tranpose row vector
np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]]).T
array([[1],
       [2],
       [3],
       [4],
       [5],
       [6]])
1.11 Flattening a Matrix
Problem
Y ou need to transform a matrix into a one-dimensional array.
Solution
Use flatten:
# Load library
import numpy as np
# Create matrix
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For better results, preprocess the images and augment the data beforehand using
ImageDataGenerator:
# Load library
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
# Create image augmentation
augmentation = ImageDataGenerator(featurewise_center=True, # Apply ZCA whitening
                                  zoom_range=0.3, # Randomly zoom in on images
                                  width_shift_range=0.2, # Randomly shift images
                                  horizontal_flip=True, # Randomly flip images
                                  rotation_range=90) # Randomly rotate
# Process all images from the directory 'raw/images'
augment_images = augmentation.flow_from_directory("raw/images", # Image folder
                                                  batch_size=32, # Batch size
                                                  class_mode="binary", # Classes
                                                  save_to_dir="processed/images")
